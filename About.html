      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        I am Shandalle Blaire C. Deliquiña, and I am the founder of <b>Green Future PH</b>, a youth-led advocacy dedicated to promoting renewable energy and climate action in the Philippines. My journey began as a high school student who became increasingly aware of the impact of climate change on my community—rising temperatures, stronger typhoons, and the growing threat to our future. I realized that while the problem is global, action can begin right here, in small ways, at home and in school.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started with simple initiatives—like encouraging classmates to conserve electricity, organize tree-planting activities, and speak up about renewable energy—has grown into an advocacy to inspire other young people to act. I believe that the Philippines has the power to lead in clean, sustainable energy, and it begins with raising awareness today.

      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Philippine Science high school student passionate about protecting the planet and pushing for a clean energy future. Through <b>Green Future PH</b>, I create awareness campaigns, share practical tips on energy conservation, and highlight the benefits of renewable sources like solar and wind. My mission is to show that no matter your age, you can make a difference in the fight against climate change.
