          <h2>Background of the Problem</h2>
          <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues today, driven mainly by the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities. Rising global temperatures have led to stronger typhoons, severe droughts, and rising sea levels that threaten millions of people worldwide. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Earth has already warmed by 1.1Â°C compared to pre-industrial levels, and without urgent action, it could reach 1.5Â°C by 2030, causing irreversible damage.</p>
          <p>In the Philippines, the countryâ€™s geographical location makes it one of the most vulnerable to climate change. Each year, the Philippines experiences an average of 20 tropical cyclones, and sea levels are rising at a rate of 60 centimeters per century, faster than the global average. These changes endanger agriculture, fisheries, and communities living in low-lying coastal areas.</p>

          <h2>What is Being Done</h2>
          <p>Globally, countries have signed the Paris Agreement, committing to limit global warming to below 2Â°C and ideally 1.5Â°C. Many governments are investing in renewable energy, such as wind, solar, and hydro power, while phasing out coal and other fossil fuels. Organizations and movements worldwide also promote tree planting, sustainable farming, and eco-friendly technologies.</p>
          <p>In the Philippines, renewable energy initiatives are expanding, with more solar farms, wind turbines, and hydroelectric plants being built. Local communities and NGOs are also leading grassroots campaigns, such as mangrove reforestation, coastal clean-ups, and education programs to raise awareness about climate change.</p>
